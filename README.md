# Fuzzy-logic-DHD

fuzzy-logic-DHD is very useful and helpful tool for heart diseases dignostics

# Features
(i)High level of prediction
(ii)Using gradient boosting for more fast and accurate recognition and prediction

SeasUp has no modular structure, it's a complete project which has only 3 scripts. First for training , second for prediction , third for graph

# Tech
A line is written in Python3 and uses many third-party libraries to implement neural network's work. To run the code from the repository you need to have the following list of installed modules:

NumPy - package for scientific computing with Python
SciKit-Learn - free software machine learning library
Pandas - library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools
XGBoost - open-source software library which provides a gradient boosting framework
All this technologies provide us stable and good work with our project

SeasUp reqires Python3 to run Install the dependencies and clone the repo:

$ cd seasup
$ git clone https://github.com/vigneshwaran2820/Fuzzy-logic-DHD
